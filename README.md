# Bus Productivity Tracker

A simple and effective productivity tracker app for people who want to make use of their travel time. Designed with the idea of tracking **DSA progress**, **daily goals**, and **personal savings** — especially during idle travel hours like on the bus.

 # Features

- 🧠 Whiteboard-like daily goal tracker
- 📊 DSA progress tracker (topics covered, time spent)
- 💰 Daily/weekly savings log
- 📅 Simple dashboard to visualize progress

 # Motivation

Often during travel (e.g., bus rides), we lose valuable time that could be used for learning or tracking our progress. This app was born out of the desire to turn idle time into productive time.
